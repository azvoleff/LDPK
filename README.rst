TEAM Landsat Data Processing Toolkit
===============================================================================

Overview
_______________________________________________________________________________

The `Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) Network 
<http://www.teamnetwork.org/>`_ is a global network of sites in tropical 
forests focused on collecting standardized real-time data measuring the 
response of tropical forests to changing climate, land cover and land use, and 
population.

The TEAM Landsat Data Processing Toolkit LDPT is a collection of scripts 
written in R and Python to facilitate the processing and analysis of Landsat 
imagery for measuring change in ecosystems at the landscape level.

The toolkit is still under active development. Follow the `TEAM website 
<http://www.teamnetwork.org/>`_ for news, and the `LDPT project page on github
<https://github.com/azvoleff/TEAM_Landat>`_ for the latest version of the code.
