TEAM Data Processing Tools (Python)

Overview
_______________________________________________________________________________

The `Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) Network 
<http://www.teamnetwork.org/>`_ is a global network of sites in tropical 
forests focused on collecting standardized real-time data measuring the 
response of tropical forests to changing climate, land cover and land use, and 
population.

The TEAM Data Processing Tools are a collection of scripts written in R and 
Python to facilitate the processing and analysis of TEAM data and remote 
sensing imagery of TEAM sites for measuring change in ecosystems from the 
plot-landscape scales.  This package includes the Python scripts in the 
toolkit.  The `teamr package
<https://github.com/azvoleff/teamr>`_ includes the R scripts that are part of 
the toolkit. Both packages are required in order to use the toolkit.

The toolkit is still under active development. Follow the `TEAM website 
<http://www.teamnetwork.org/>`_ for news, and the `toolkit project page on 
github
<https://github.com/azvoleff/teampy>`_ for the latest version of the code.
